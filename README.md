# Matt Smith's Dotfiles

My original dotfiles came from a fork of a colleague of mine. I've learned a
lot since that time, and now it's time to start again from scratch with my own
personal quirks completely throughout the repo. Here's to another fun ride!

These dotfiles are designed for Mac

## Installation

```
# Clone to a repo next to your personal git repos
$ git clone git@github.com:mtscout6/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```
